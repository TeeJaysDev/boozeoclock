## 🚀 About project
Given the [Cocktail API](https://cocktails.solvro.pl/) I had to fetch the data and display it properly on a user-friendly website.

This website was created as a recruitment project for [KN Solvro](https://solvro.pwr.edu.pl/) - a science club working as a software house at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Poland. During this project I had an opportunity of learning NextJS 14 on the go.
